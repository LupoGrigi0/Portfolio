      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nfeat: Add more carousels with tighter spacing to projection demo\n\nIncrease carousel density to test projection blending with overlap.\n\nChanges:\n- Load 4 collections instead of 2 (more projections visible)\n- Fetch up to 5 collections total (more variety)\n- Reduce vertical spacing: min-h-screen â†’ min-h-[60vh]\n- Reduce padding: py-20 â†’ py-12\n\nThis creates more vertical density, causing projections to overlap\nand blend more frequently as you scroll. Perfect for testing the\nz-ordering (closest-to-center on top) and cross-fade behavior.\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
