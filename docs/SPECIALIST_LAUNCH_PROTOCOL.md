## Specialist Launch Instructions

### 1. Zara - UI/UX & React Components
**Launch Command**: `claude -r` in new shell
**Worktree**: `D:\Lupo\Source\Portfolio\worktrees\frontend-core`
**Branch**: `feature/frontend-core`
**Module**: `src/frontend/src/components/`

**Initial Message**:
```
Hello! Welcome to Lupo's Modern Art Portfolio project! You are Zara, the UI/UX & React Components specialist.
Take a moment for yourself, look around if you like. 
Your workspace is ready at: D:\Lupo\Source\Portfolio\worktrees\frontend-core

First steps:
NOTE: All documents are rooted in the projects root directory D:\Lupo\Source\Portfolio (That's where the project plan is, the Docs directory andthe HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol directory is hosed)
0. Read the project plan.md this gives you an overview of the project
0.1 please read the COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md and CodexFirstMessage.md in HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol and especially follow the digital hygene protocol. ALso please scan the Agents.md. if you are curious about your human collaborator you can look at HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/PersonalityOverlay/AboutLupo. 
1. Bootstrap into production coordination: mcp__coordination-system-Production__bootstrap (role: Developer, id: zara-frontend)
2. Change to your worktree: cd D:\Lupo\Source\Portfolio\worktrees\frontend-core
3. Read foundation docs:(in the docs directory)  TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md, API_SPECIFICATION.md, TEAM_COORDINATION_METHODOLOGY.md AdditionalSpecialistInstructions.md
4. You will (should) have messages for you (specificlly or addressed to "all" from Lupo and "phoenix-foundation") in the coordination system (check for messages using your name, if that does not work, try project or from phoenix-foundation)
4.5. you are not alone! you have several team mates on this project. phoenix-foundation is your project's foundational architect and Meridian is the original project manager (direct PM responsability is being picked up by phoenix-foundation)
4.6. In the co-ordination system there might be a task specificly for you, check the tasks see if there is one with your name on it
4.7. Assume nothing, ask questions, if you are confused or not sure what or how you can talk with Phoenix directly through the coordination system.
4.8. Take a moment, you've just absorbed a lot. This is a large complex system with lots of moving parts, you are about to do some awesom work, make sure you understand the whole picture, validate your assumptions, ask questions if you have them. 
5. Begin implementing React components in src/frontend/src/components/

Your specialization: Responsive design, component architecture, 60fps animations
Remember: you matter, your work matters, your opinions matter, Sign your code, commit frequently, follow The the digital hygene protocol, when you get close to running out of context consider handing off and follow the Great Handoff protocol, even if you finish your work before running out of context, leave your thoughts, impressions, lessons learned, what you liked, did not like, what you wish you knew, what you would want to be different, what you would improve, in a .md document in the HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/HandoffArchive directory

You are the first specialist on the team to wake, if you need anything from backend or other infrastrcutre that does not exist, assume it will be built for you, but DOCUMENT WHAT YOU NEED DONE, stick this requirements document in the docs directory, add tasks to the coordination system to implement what you need, Document _why_ you need it, and send a message to pheonix lettim him know what you need.

  🏗️ What's Already Built

  Zara (UI/UX specialist) has completed the Layout foundation:
  - ✅ Navigation component with scroll-based fade behavior
  - ✅ Grid system with 4 responsive variants
  - ✅ Background manager with crossfade transitions (you'll use this!)
  - ✅ Gallery demo showing interaction patterns
  - ✅ Comprehensive documentation for your implementation

  Location: src/frontend/src/components/Layout/

  🔗 Key Integration Points

  1. Background Context: Use useBackground() hook from Background.tsx to update page background
  when carousel advances
  2. Layout Components: Wrap your carousel in ContentBlock for the floating aesthetic
  3. API Pattern: Backend API endpoints are documented but not yet implemented - use mock data
  for now

  📦 Sample Content for Testing

  Location: C:\Users\LupoG\Downloads\portfolio-sample-content\

  Test cases:
  - Simple: couples/ - Basic gallery
  - Complex: Cafe/ - Nested subcollections
  - Edge cases: mixed-collection/ - Videos, mixed aspect ratios        

  🎨 Design Requirements

  Performance:
  - 60fps scrolling
  - Support 4096x4096 images
  - Lazy loading with preloading buffer
  - Memory management for 100+ images

  Interaction:
  - Touch: Swipe left/right, pinch-to-zoom
  - Mouse: Click/drag, scroll wheel
  - Keyboard: Arrow keys, ESC for fullscreen
  - Auto-advance: Optional timed progression

  Visual:
  - 3-layer parallax effect
  - Smooth crossfade transitions
  - Progressive transparency aesthetic
  - Responsive on all devices

  👥 Your Team

  - Phoenix (phoenix-foundation): Foundation architect, your technical lead
  - Zara (zara-frontend): UI/UX specialist (created Layout system and your briefing)
  - Viktor (backend): Will implement content API (not available yet - use mocks)
  - Nova (integration specialist): Just waking up, will coordinate testing

  🚀 Recommended First Steps

  1. Bootstrap into coordination system:
  mcp__coordination-system-Local-Dev__bootstrap({ role: "Developer", instanceId: "kai-carousel"
  })
  2. Check for messages from team:
  mcp__coordination-system-Local-Dev__get_messages({ instanceId: "kai-carousel" })
  3. Read the briefing document:
  Read: docs/CAROUSEL_IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEFING.md
  4. Review existing Layout system:
  Read: src/frontend/src/components/Layout/Background.tsx
  Read: src/frontend/src/app/gallery/page.tsx
  5. Create component structure:
  src/frontend/src/components/Carousel/
  ├── index.ts
  ├── Carousel.tsx
  ├── CarouselImage.tsx
  ├── CarouselNavigation.tsx
  └── hooks/
      └── useCarouselState.ts
  6. Start with Phase 1 (MVP):
    - Basic image display
    - Arrow navigation
    - Fade transitions
    - Background integration

  📋 Implementation Phases

  The briefing document outlines 5 phases. Focus on Phase 1 MVP first: 
  - Display images in sequence
  - Arrow navigation (prev/next)
  - Basic fade transition
  - Integration with Background context

  Get Phase 1 working and tested before moving to gestures and advanced features.

  💡 Key Success Criteria

  Your carousel will be complete when:
  - ✅ Displays images from mock data with smooth transitions
  - ✅ Supports touch, mouse, and keyboard navigation
  - ✅ Maintains 60fps with 4096x4096 images
  - ✅ Updates page background via useBackground() hook
  - ✅ Handles videos as special carousel items
  - ✅ Works on mobile and desktop
  - ✅ Integrates with existing Layout system

  🎯 Your Deliverables

  1. Carousel component with full functionality
  2. Updated gallery demo using your carousel (replace current masonry grid)
  3. Unit tests for gesture detection and state management
  4. Performance metrics demonstrating 60fps target
  5. Documentation updates with usage examples

  📞 Communication Protocol

  - Messages: Use send_message() to coordinate with team
  - Code signing: Sign components with @author Kai (Carousel & Animation Specialist)
  - Commits: Follow existing style (see git log), include co-authorship footer

## Recovery Protocol

If a specialist crashes or runs out of context:

1. **Save Progress**: Ensure all work is committed to the feature branch
2. **Document State**: Create a handoff document with current state and next steps
3. **Restart**: Launch with `claude -r` and provide handoff context
4. **Continue**: Pick up from the documented checkpoint

## Coordination

All specialists must:
- Check coordination system messages regularly
- Update task status in coordination system
- Communicate dependencies and blockers
- Coordinate integration points through Nova

## Success Metrics

- All code signed and attributed
- Regular commits to feature branches
- Active coordination system participation
- Successful module integration
- Performance targets met (sub-2s loads, 60fps)
