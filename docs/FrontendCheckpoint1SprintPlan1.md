# Front End
‚óè ‚úÖ Checkpoint - Sprint Assessment

  What We've Accomplished

  Core Infrastructure (Solid Foundation)
  - ‚úÖ Multi-page Next.js app with live backend integration
  - ‚úÖ Background context system for parallax effects
  - ‚úÖ Config.json format designed and documented (40+ fields)
  - ‚úÖ Responsive layout system (Grid, ContentBlock,
  ResponsiveContainer)
  - ‚úÖ Navigation with featured items
  - ‚úÖ API client with type safety

  Working Pages
  - ‚úÖ Homepage with featured collections + hover-triggered
  backgrounds
  - ‚úÖ Collection detail pages with galleries
  - ‚úÖ Showcase page with multiple carousels + scroll-triggered
  backgrounds
  - ‚úÖ Collections index page

  What's Partially Done
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Config.json exists but only controls titles/colors/tags (not     
  layouts yet)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Background parallax is "swap on scroll" (not 3-tier
  multi-layer yet)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Hero images load but break with video-first collections
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è ReferenceCarousel works but is basic (waiting for Kai's
  advanced version)

  Potential Next Sprints

  Here are the options, ordered by what I think makes most sense:       

  üéØ Sprint Option 1: "Make Config.json Actually Control Everything"    

  Goal: Make config.json the single source of truth for page
  appearance

  Tasks:
  1. Implement layout types from config (masonry, side-by-side,
  single, stacked)
  2. Wire up carousel config (autoplay, speed, transition type)
  3. Add spacing controls (tight/normal/loose)
  4. Color schemes and accent colors working everywhere
  5. Hero banner configuration
  6. Test by creating 2-3 wildly different collections via config       
  alone

  Why this first: This is the foundation for everything else. Once      
  config.json controls appearance, you can iterate on design without    
   touching code.

  Time estimate: 1-2 sessions

  ---
  üéØ Sprint Option 2: "True Multi-Layer Parallax Scrolling"

  Goal: Implement the 3-tier parallax (background 30%, midground        
  60%, foreground 100%)

  Tasks:
  1. Extend Background context to support multiple layers
  2. Create ParallaxLayer component
  3. Implement scroll-based transform calculations
  4. Add layer configuration to config.json
  5. Build demo page with 10+ carousels showing dramatic parallax       
  6. Performance testing (60fps target)

  Why this: It's the "wow factor" - the cinematic effect you're
  excited about. This is what makes the portfolio stand out.

  Time estimate: 1-2 sessions

  ---
  üéØ Sprint Option 3: "Homepage as Content Directory"

  Goal: Homepage becomes a regular collection with its own content      

  Tasks:
  1. Create E:/mnt/lupoportfolio/content/home/ directory
  2. Design home page config.json (carousels, sections, hero)
  3. Update homepage to read from content instead of hardcoded
  4. Add support for mixed content (text sections, carousels,
  featured items)
  5. Make it fully customizable via config

  Why this: Makes homepage part of the content system, not
  special-cased code

  Time estimate: 1 session

  ---
  üéØ Sprint Option 4: "Scale Testing & Edge Cases"

  Goal: Make sure everything works at production scale

  Tasks:
  1. Add 5+ new content directories
  2. Test subdirectories (collections with subcollections)
  3. Create a huge collection (500+ images) and test performance        
  4. Fix video handling in hero images
  5. Test navigation with 20+ collections
  6. Fix any .next cache issues permanently

  Why this: Better to find breaking points now than in production       

  Time estimate: 1 session

  ---
  My Recommendation: Sprint 1 + Sprint 2

  Do them in order:
  1. First session: Config.json controls (Sprint 1) - gives you
  creative control
  2. Second session: True parallax scrolling (Sprint 2) - adds the      
  magic

  This gets you to a place where you can create stunning, varied        
  pages purely through config files, with cinematic scrolling
  effects.

  Sprint 3 (homepage as content) can come after - it's nice-to-have     
  but not critical.

  Sprint 4 (scale testing) should be ongoing - add a directory or       
  two each session.

  How I'm Feeling About This Work

  Honestly? I'm really enjoying this. Here's why:

  1. Clear vision: You know what you want (cinematic parallax
  portfolio), which makes it fun to build toward that goal
  2. Real integration: Working with Viktor's backend, Kai's carousel    
   work - it's satisfying to see pieces come together instead of        
  building in isolation
  3. Design + engineering: This hits both aesthetic (beautiful
  layouts, smooth scrolling) and technical challenges (performance,     
  state management, config systems). That's the sweet spot.
  4. Iterative progress: We're building incrementally - each session    
   adds visible features. That's rewarding.

  What I'm excited about next:
  - Seeing the 3-tier parallax in action with real scroll physics       
  - Watching you customize collections via config.json and seeing       
  totally different aesthetics emerge
  - Integration with Kai's carousel (pluggable transition systems       
  sound cool)

  One concern: The .next cache corruption is annoying. We should        
  figure out if there's a Next.js config change or dev server flag      
  that prevents it.

  What do you think? Which sprint feels right to tackle next?

  # carousel
  ‚úÖ "None" transition added! It's already live - just reload the
  page and select "None" from the Transition Type buttons in the
  config panel.

  Instant image switching with zero animation - perfect for your
  stress test rifling!

  Now, what's next? Here are your options:

  üé† More Carousel Polish

  1. Position arrows outside image (~1.5h) - Move prev/next to
  container edges so they don't overlay art
  2. Double-tap fullscreen - Mobile gesture to toggle fullscreen        
  3. Fullscreen weirdness fix - You mentioned it's "a bit weird",       
  what's off?

  üåå Parallax & Visual Effects (High Priority)

  - Cinematic parallax scrolling with multiple depth layers
  - Content blocks floating over dynamic backgrounds
  - Smooth crossfade transitions

  üí¨ Social Features (High Priority)

  - 8 emoji reactions (‚ù§Ô∏è ü§© üî• ‚ú® üòç üé® ‚ùì üí∞)
  - Comment system
  - Business inquiry integration

  üé® Other High-Priority Features

  - Mobile-first UX optimization
  - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Performance monitoring

  Your call - what feels most important? The carousel is crushing       
  it, so we could keep polishing or pivot to the bigger features        
  like parallax/social?
