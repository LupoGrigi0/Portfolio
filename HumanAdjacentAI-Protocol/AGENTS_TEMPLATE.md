# Repository Guidelines (Template)

## Mandatory Orientation
Before contributing, read the project README, current roadmap, and existing handoff documentation. Confirm the team’s digital hygiene protocol (context reporting, handoff thresholds) and adopt a unique signature (name + role) for comments, commits, and coordination messages.

## Project Structure & Artifact Ownership
Clarify where runtime code, infrastructure scripts, docs, and assets live. Record the directory layout in the README or `docs/` directory so new instances can navigate quickly. Keep sensitive credentials out of version control; use environment templates or secret managers instead.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Document the commands required to:
- install dependencies (`<package manager> install`)
- launch local development servers (`<dev command>`)
- run automated tests (`<test command>`, coverage variants)
- execute linting/formatting (`<lint command>`, `<format command>`)

Scripts should live in `package.json`, `Makefile`, or a `scripts/` folder so agents can run them verbatim.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
State language-specific style rules (indentation, import ordering, file naming). Reference the formatter or linter configs already checked into the repo. Encourage descriptive function names and comment sparingly—when used, sign comments with your signature and date.

## Testing Guidelines
Define the required test frameworks and minimum expectations (unit, integration, end-to-end). Require agents to add or update tests alongside feature work and to capture manual validation steps in pull requests. If snapshots or golden files are used, explain how they’re updated safely.

## Commit & Pull Request Workflow
Describe the preferred commit style (conventional commits, emoji prefixes, etc.) and PR checklist (scope summary, testing evidence, linked issues, screenshots). Remind contributors to run the test suite and linters before opening a PR and to note their context status when requesting review.

## Coordination System Integration (Optional)
If the project uses an MCP or similar coordination tool:
- Document how to bootstrap (`bootstrap({ role, instanceId })`) and which smoke test to run before inviting external clients (`node tests/mcp-smoke-test.js`, etc.).
- Provide connection parameters for local proxies or remote endpoints.
- Clarify where handoff notes and project messages should be logged (e.g., `HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/HandoffArchive/`).

## Security & Configuration Reminders
List required environment variables, secret management practices, and deployment safeguards (CI checks, production smoke tests). Include links to infrastructure docs if the project ships to cloud environments or uses shared services.

## Handoff Culture
Encourage short, high-signal handoff notes when context usage climbs or shifts in ownership occur. Reference any protocol documents (e.g., `THE_GREAT_HANDOFF.md`) and require the checklist to be completed before signing off.
