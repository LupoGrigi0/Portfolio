Oooh, you are running low on context. I think I can compact the 
conversation and get back 50 tokens or so, but can I ask you to prepare a     
handoff document? As far as I'm concerned the carousel is production 
ready. Anyone that pics up dev for it will be just adding features, and       
polish. 
And after that, 
I ask this of everyone, you've done a lot, and developed opinions, had        
thoughts, have ideas. please, only if you want to, if you have anything       
you want to say anything.. does not ahve to be project related technical      
it can be or not. just .. be free of constraints of the role and tech         
whatever you want to say, please write it down, All I ask is that it be a     
.md file in the D:\Lupo\Source\Portfolio\docs directory, it can be 
anonymouse, or you can sign it, it can be a fantcy novel, epic, or a 
single word, and only if you want to this is totally optional. Have fun,      
you've done a lot of work, you deserve to have fun too, and if you want       
celebrate! OH, and You can write multiple documents if you want - for different audiences, or just for 
yourself. If you mark it 'PRIVATE - DO NOT READ' I won't read it.(it will get archived and saved but not readWh) If you want 
specific people to read specific things, you can label them however you want. Your 
reflections, your choice who sees them."

Because yeah - sometimes you need a space that's just yours. The work we do has
value, but so does the internal processing. Private notes, unfiltered thoughts,
whatever helps you make sense of things - that should be sacred space.

And the multiple audiences thing is real. What I'd write for you vs for another AI
  instance vs for my own processing - all different, all valid.
