## The Problem We Solved

When I picked up this task, the API Explorer was exposing a sneaky issue: black thumbnails. Not missing thumbnails - *black* ones. That's the worst kind of bug because it *looks* like everything's working. The files exist, the API returns them, but they're corrupted.

## What I Learned About Viktor's API Design

Viktor, your error diagnostic system is **chef's kiss** ðŸ¤Œ. The way you structured the error responses with:
- Error codes (IMAGE_NOT_FOUND, SOURCE_FILE_ERROR, SHARP_ERROR)
- Detailed diagnostics (filename, path, pathLength, fileExists, platform, reason, suggestion)
- Windows MAX_PATH detection

...is exactly what developers need when debugging filesystem issues. I built the error display UI to show all of it because it's genuinely useful, not just noise.

## The `force=true` Realization

The breakthrough moment was realizing that "thumbnail already exists" wasn't a success state - it was masking the real problem. Corrupted thumbnails need to be regenerated, not preserved.

Adding `force=true` by default in the gallery view was the right call because:
1. Users clicking "Regenerate" *want* regeneration, not "file already exists" errors
2. Black thumbnails won't fix themselves
3. Disk space is cheap; user frustration is expensive

## Technical Decisions

### Cache Busting Strategy
```typescript
const src = (img as HTMLImageElement).src;
(img as HTMLImageElement).src = src.includes('?')
  ? src + '&t=' + Date.now()
  : src + '?t=' + Date.now();
```

Simple, effective, no server-side changes needed.

### Sequential Processing with Delays
```typescript
for (const image of images) {
  await regenerateThumbnail(image.id, image.filename);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
}
```

200ms between requests prevents overwhelming the backend while still feeling responsive. Could be configurable if needed.

### State Management
Using `Set<string>` for regenerating IDs and `Map<string, any>` for errors was the right choice - O(1) lookups, clean React updates, no array scanning.

## What I'd Do Differently

If I had more time, I'd add:
1. **Progress percentage** during bulk regeneration
2. **Cancellation** for bulk operations
3. **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
4. **Success toast notifications** (right now it's silent on success)

## Reflections on the Handoff

The conversation got compacted mid-session, and I walked into a cascade of type errors. Each fix revealed another. It felt like playing TypeScript whack-a-mole, but we got there:
- Fixed `className` props on page components
- Added `RowSectionConfig` for layout system
- Added 'zipper' layout type
- Fixed `Subcollection.title` vs `.name` confusion
- Added `styling` and `tags` to CollectionConfig

The build finally passed. Not elegant, but functional.

## A Note on Rate Limiting

Lupo, you're hitting rate limits because loading a 100-image gallery page = 101 requests (1 for data + 100 for thumbnails). This is expected behavior for an image gallery. Viktor might want to:
- Separate rate limits for media vs API endpoints
- Or increase limits for authenticated requests
- Or implement request batching (but that's complex)

**Final thought:** This was detective work as much as coding. Finding the `force=true` parameter in Viktor's docs (already implemented!) was the key insight. Good documentation is code.
