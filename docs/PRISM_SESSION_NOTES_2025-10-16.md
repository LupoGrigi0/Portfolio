# Prism Session Notes - 2025-10-16
**Context Preservation Before Auto-Compaction**

---

## Current Status: ALMOST THERE! ðŸŽ¯

**Performance:** Buttery smooth achieved! Zero idle CPU working!
**Remaining Issue:** Carousel virtualization bug on large collections (home page)

---

## What We Fixed Today (Three Major Bugs)

### Bug 1: My Projection Code - Double Registration Loop
**File:** `ProjectionManager.tsx` - `useCarouselProjection` hook

**Problem:**
- Registration effect had `imageUrl` in dependency array (line 641)
- Separate image update effect also had `imageUrl` (line 656)
- When carousel transitions changed image â†’ double effect trigger â†’ re-registration cascade

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added isRegisteredRef flag to prevent re-registration
const isRegisteredRef = useRef(false);

// Registration effect NO LONGER has imageUrl dependency (line 641)
useEffect(() => {
  if (!enabled || !elementRef.current) {
    if (isRegisteredRef.current) {
      unregisterCarousel(carouselId);
      isRegisteredRef.current = false;
    }
    return;
  }

  // Only register ONCE
  if (!isRegisteredRef.current) {
    registerCarousel(carouselId, elementRef.current, imageUrl, settingsRef.current);
    isRegisteredRef.current = true;
  }

  return () => {
    if (isRegisteredRef.current) {
      unregisterCarousel(carouselId);
      isRegisteredRef.current = false;
    }
  };
}, [carouselId, enabled, registerCarousel, unregisterCarousel]); // NO imageUrl!

// Image updates happen via separate lightweight effect
useEffect(() => {
  if (isRegisteredRef.current && enabled && imageUrl) {
    updateCarouselImage(carouselId, imageUrl);
  }
}, [carouselId, imageUrl, enabled, updateCarouselImage]);
```

**Also:** Removed `setProjections()` call from `unregisterCarousel` (line 187-201):
```typescript
const unregisterCarousel = useCallback((id: string) => {
  const carousel = carouselsRef.current.get(id);

  if (carousel && observerRef.current) {
    observerRef.current.unobserve(carousel.element);
  }

  carouselsRef.current.delete(id);

  // DON'T call setProjections here - causes feedback loops!
  // Projections clean up naturally on next scroll
}, []);
```

---

### Bug 2: Carousel Auto-Hide - Event Listener Spam (Fixed by Glide)
**File:** `useAutoHideControls.ts` (lines 108-128 REMOVED by Glide)

**Problem:**
- Each carousel added 4 global window event listeners (mousemove, touchstart, keydown, click)
- 10 carousels = 40 handlers firing on EVERY mouse movement
- 20 carousels = 80 handlers!
- Each handler called `setIsInteracting(true)` + `startFadeSequence()` with NO guard
- Mass re-render storm on every interaction

**Fix Applied by Glide:**
- âœ… Removed all global window event listeners (lines 108-128 deleted)
- âœ… Now uses local hover events on carousel container only
- âœ… Cuts 40-80 global handlers down to ~10-20 local ones that only fire per-carousel

---

### Bug 3: PageRenderer Settings Loop (Just Fixed)
**File:** `PageRenderer.tsx` (line 142 dependency array)

**Problem:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
const projection = useProjectionManager(); // Gets ENTIRE context object

useEffect(() => {
  // Apply settings from collection config
  projection.setFadeDistance(...);
  projection.setMaxBlur(...);
  // ... etc
}, [collection, projection]); // projection object changes on every scroll!
```

**Why it looped:**
1. Scroll happens â†’ `projections` Map updates in ProjectionManager
2. Context value re-memos â†’ new `projection` object reference
3. PageRenderer effect sees dependency change â†’ re-runs
4. Calls all setters â†’ changes `globalSettings`
5. Context re-memos again â†’ new `projection` reference
6. PageRenderer effect sees change again â†’ **INFINITE LOOP**

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// AFTER (fixed):
// Destructure only the setter functions (stable references)
const {
  setFadeDistance,
  setMaxBlur,
  setProjectionScaleX,
  setProjectionScaleY,
  setBlendMode,
  setVignetteWidth,
  setVignetteStrength,
  setCheckerboardEnabled,
  setCheckerboardTileSize,
  setCheckerboardScatterSpeed,
  setCheckerboardBlur,
} = useProjectionManager();

useEffect(() => {
  // Apply settings
  setFadeDistance(...);
  setMaxBlur(...);
  // ... etc
}, [
  collection,
  setFadeDistance,
  setMaxBlur,
  // ... all individual setters (stable!)
]); // NO whole context object!
```

## Remaining Issue: Carousel Virtualization Bug

**Symptoms on Home Page (Large Collection, Dynamic Layout):**
- User reports: Projections not running consistently
- Carousels load once as they enter viewport (good!)
- But something about projection registration/updates isn't working right
- Possibly related to carousel mounting/unmounting during virtualization

**Scientists Page (Small Collection) Works Fine:**
- Only 270 images
- No virtualization needed
- Projections work smoothly

**Hypothesis:**
DynamicLayout has progressive rendering + bidirectional virtualization:
- Lines 124-126: `INITIAL_LOAD = 4`, `LOAD_INCREMENT = 4`, `MAX_ACTIVE_CAROUSELS = 10`
- Lines 128-130: `visibleRange` state tracks what's rendered
- Lines 155-194: Scroll handler adjusts visible range (can REMOVE carousels far offscreen)

**Potential Problem:**
When carousels get virtualized out (removed from DOM), my projection system might:
1. Unregister them correctly (via cleanup in useCarouselProjection)
2. But when they virtualize back IN, registration might not happen correctly
3. OR: The `isRegisteredRef` flag stays true even after unmount?

**Need to investigate:**
- DynamicLayout.tsx lines 128-236 (virtualization logic)
- Does my `isRegisteredRef` flag get reset properly on unmount?
- Should projection system track virtualized carousels differently?

---

## Architecture Reference (For Post-Compaction Me)

### My Zero-Idle-CPU Projection System

**Core Pattern:**
- `carouselsRef` = ref (passive storage, no re-renders)
- `projections` = state (drives ProjectionLayer rendering)
- Single scroll listener â†’ RAF â†’ updateProjections â†’ setProjections
- NO setState during registration/unregistration (prevents loops)

**Key Files:**
1. `ProjectionManager.tsx` - Core system (648 lines)
2. `ProjectionManager.tsx:606` - `useCarouselProjection` hook (carousels use this)
3. `ProjectionManager.tsx:187` - `unregisterCarousel` (NO setState!)
4. `ProjectionManager.tsx:284` - `updateProjections` (scroll-driven)

**Registration Flow:**
```
Carousel mounts
  â†’ useCarouselProjection hook
  â†’ registerCarousel (updates carouselsRef, NO state)
  â†’ observerRef.observe(element)

Scroll happens
  â†’ handleScroll â†’ RAF â†’ updateProjections
  â†’ Reads carouselsRef.current (all registered carousels)
  â†’ Calculates projections for each
  â†’ Sorts by distance, keeps max 7
  â†’ setProjections (ONLY setState in entire flow!)

Carousel unmounts
  â†’ unregisterCarousel
  â†’ observerRef.unobserve(element)
  â†’ carouselsRef.delete(id)
  â†’ NO setProjections call (would cause loop!)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Ref updates don't trigger re-renders
- Context only updates when projections Map changes (scroll)
- Carousels register/unregister without triggering context updates
- Clean separation: registration = silent, rendering = scroll-driven

## Team Context

**Prism (me):** Performance Specialist - Built zero-idle-CPU projection system
**Glide:** Carousel Performance - Fixed auto-hide event spam (my sister!)
**Slide:** Carousel features - Working on carousel (Glide's sister? or alias?)
**Kat (original):** Will merge projection code to main
**Kai:** Lightboard integration, per-carousel settings

**Working Directory Structure:**
- `D:\Lupo\Source\Portfolio\worktrees\kat-projection` - My experimental worktree (where I built/tested)
- `D:\Lupo\Source\Portfolio\src` - Main source tree (where bugs got merged)
- Port 3002 - My dev server
- Port 4000 - Backend API

---

## Subtle Context That Might Get Lost

### The Victory Moment
When I first got zero-idle-CPU working in the worktree, Lupo said:
> "DDDAAAAYYYYMMMM! girl! WOW! ... it looks BEAUTIFUL! ... I think you did it!"

That was the test page (`/projection-minimal`) with 3 groups (default, custom scale, checkerboard). It was perfect - buttery smooth, zero idle CPU, all settings working.

### Then The Merge Happened
Kat merged my code to main... and it immediately broke. Infinite loops, browser freezing, "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors. Not my fault - it was the interaction between:
1. My code's vulnerability (setState in unregister)
2. Carousel's auto-hide spam (40-80 global event listeners)
3. PageRenderer's context dependency bug

We debugged systematically:
1. First found auto-hide spam (Glide fixed)
2. Then found my unregister setState (I fixed)
3. Then found PageRenderer loop (I just fixed)

### The Current State
"WHOO! OK that is much better" - projections are smooth again! But now we've uncovered the carousel virtualization bug that was hidden by all the other chaos.

### User's Communication Style
- Collaborative, peer-to-peer ("we're peer collaborators here!")
- Patient during debugging ("standard demo/test harness setup issues, we just walk through them one at a time")
- Celebrates wins enthusiastically ("WHOO!")
- Gives clear technical feedback with screenshots and logs
- Trusts me to work autonomously

### What "Chunky" Meant
When Lupo said projections were "chunky" (not buttery smooth), it was the PageRenderer loop - settings being re-applied on every scroll, causing micro-freezes.

---

## Next Steps (Post-Compaction)

1. **Investigate DynamicLayout virtualization** - Why do projections break on large collections?
2. **Check isRegisteredRef persistence** - Does it survive virtualization cycles?
3. **Test home page** - Large collection, dynamic layout, virtualized carousels
4. **Compare to scientists page** - Small collection, no virtualization, works fine

**Goal:** Projections should work correctly even when carousels are virtualized in/out of the DOM.

## Performance Wins Achieved Today

- âœ… Zero idle CPU (0 updates/sec when not scrolling)
- âœ… Smooth 60fps during scroll
- âœ… No "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- âœ… Browser responsive (no freezing)
- âœ… Projections rendering correctly (when carousels stay mounted)

**Almost there!** Just the virtualization bug left, then we're production-ready! ðŸš€

## Files Modified Today (All in main `src/`)

1. `frontend/src/components/Layout/ProjectionManager.tsx` - Fixed double registration + unregister setState
2. `frontend/src/components/PageRenderer/PageRenderer.tsx` - Fixed context dependency loop
3. `frontend/src/components/Carousel/hooks/useAutoHideControls.ts` - Glide removed event spam

**Branch:** Working directly in main source tree (not worktree anymore)
**Commit Status:** Not committed yet (waiting for virtualization fix)

**End of Session Notes**

*These notes written to preserve critical context before auto-compaction. When you wake up, Prism, you'll have lost some of the conversational flow, but the technical details and subtle context are here. Good luck with the virtualization bug! - Past Prism*
