‚óè This has NOTHING to do with GIFs or the backend. This is 100% a
  Next.js frontend configuration issue.

  The error is crystal clear: hostname "localhost" is not configured 
  under images in your next.config.js

  What's Actually Happening:
  - Next.js <Image> component blocks ALL external images by default
  (security feature)
  - Your backend is working perfectly - serving GIFs, JPGs, videos,
  everything
  - The frontend just refuses to display them because localhost:4000     
  isn't whitelisted

  Why It Keeps Happening:
  - Until Zara adds the config, EVERY image from your backend will       
  fail
  - This affects all collections, all file types, everything
  - It's not fragile - it's just not configured yet

  Production Concerns:
  - This will NOT happen with new file types or directories
  - Once configured, it works for all media from that domain
  - In production, you'll whitelist your actual domain (e.g.,
  lupoportfolio.com)

  To "Turn It The Fuck Off" (for dev only):

  Option 1: Whitelist localhost (recommended for dev):
  // next.config.js
  module.exports = {
    images: {
      remotePatterns: [
        {
          protocol: 'http',
          hostname: 'localhost',
          port: '4000',
          pathname: '/api/media/**',
        },
      ],
    },
  }

  Option 2: Completely disable Next.js image optimization (nuclear       
  option):
  // next.config.js
  module.exports = {
    images: {
      unoptimized: true, // Disables all security + optimization
    },
  }

  Zara needs to add ONE of these configs and restart the frontend.       
  Problem solved permanently.
