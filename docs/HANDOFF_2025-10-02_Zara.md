## Outgoing Instance Info
**Instance ID**: claude-code-zara-frontend-20251002
**Handoff Reason**: Context limit (95% - 190k/200k tokens)
**Context Status**: üî¥ Critical

## Current State Summary
**Active Task**: Sprint 2 - Multi-Layer Parallax Scrolling System with Interactive Controls
**Files Modified**:
- `src/frontend/src/app/parallax-demo/page.tsx` (NEW - interactive demo with control panel)
- `src/frontend/src/components/Layout/ParallaxBackground.tsx` (NEW - 3-layer parallax engine)
- `src/frontend/src/components/Layout/index.ts` (exports)
- `src/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` (switched to ParallaxBackgroundProvider)
- `src/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` (updated for new parallax system)
- `src/frontend/src/app/showcase/page.tsx` (updated for new parallax system)
- `src/scripts/start-frontend.bat` (fixed path resolution bug)

**Tests Status**: Not run (manual testing only)
**Server Status**: Running on port 3001 (port 3000 occupied by crashed process)

## Completed Work - Sprint 2

### ‚úÖ Core Parallax System
- Created `ParallaxBackground.tsx` component with 3-tier depth system
- Background/Midground/Foreground layers with independent speed/opacity/blur
- GPU-accelerated transforms using `translateY` for 60fps performance
- Smooth 1-second crossfade transitions between layer changes
- Context provider for global parallax state management

### ‚úÖ Interactive Control Panel (parallax-demo page)
- Floating collapsible control panel (bottom-right)
- **9 parallax sliders**: BG/MG/FG opacity, speed, blur
- **2 carousel sliders**: Border opacity, image opacity
- Real-time updates without re-fetching collections
- Reset to defaults button
- Visual experimentation for config.json prototyping

### ‚úÖ Performance Optimizations
- Collections fetch ONCE on mount (no re-fetch on slider changes)
- Separate useEffect for layer updates (only CSS changes)
- Sequential collection loading with 500ms delays (rate limit prevention)
- Images cached by React/Next.js
- Smooth scroll handler with section ID tracking

### ‚úÖ Bug Fixes
- Fixed rate limiting issues (was re-fetching on every slider change)
- Added fallback to first gallery image when heroImage is null
- Changed scroll direction to "natural" (negative speeds = down when scrolling down)
- Different images per layer (BG=gallery[0], MG=gallery[1], FG=gallery[2])
- Fixed start-frontend.bat path resolution (now works from scripts directory)

## In Progress

**Current Focus**: User testing parallax effect with control panel

**Known Issues**:
1. **Layer transition still has "snap" on first scroll** - Smooth within section, but instant when entering new section
2. **Some collections missing images** - Home collection shows no BG/MG layers (only uses gallery[0] if no heroImage)
3. **Port 3000 stuck** - Old server crashed, port not released (using 3001 now)
4. **First-scroll error** - Occasional undefined property access on initial scroll

**Next Steps**:
1. User is experimenting with control panel - awaiting feedback/screenshots
2. May need to add hero image upload/assignment feature
3. Consider transition timing controls in panel
4. Possible config.json export from current panel settings

**Blockers**: None currently

## Discoveries & Decisions

### Discovery: Rate Limiting Root Cause
- Adding slider state to useEffect dependencies caused infinite loop
- Every slider change re-fetched all collections from backend
- **Solution**: Split into two useEffects - fetch once, update layers separately

### Decision: Negative Speed = Natural Scroll
- Classic parallax (BG slower than FG) felt wrong for this use case
- **Chose**: Negative speeds move layers DOWN when scrolling DOWN
- User confirmed this feels "natural" for carousel showcase pages

### Decision: Different Images Per Layer
- Original design used same image 3x with different opacity/blur
- **Changed**: BG/MG/FG use different gallery images for visual variety
- Creates richer, more interesting depth effect

### Learning: Next.js Image Caching
- Images cached automatically by Next.js once loaded
- No need to implement custom cache - React handles it
- Re-renders only update CSS properties, not DOM/images

## Critical Context for Next Instance

### Parallax System Architecture
The parallax works in 3 parts:
1. **Collections fetch** (once on mount) ‚Üí sets `collections` state
2. **Scroll handler** ‚Üí sets `currentSectionId` when scrolling into new section
3. **Layer update useEffect** ‚Üí watches `currentSectionId` + slider values, updates layers

**DO NOT** add slider values to collections fetch useEffect or you'll trigger rate limits!

### Control Panel State Flow
```
User moves slider
  ‚Üí setState (bgOpacity, mgSpeed, etc)
  ‚Üí Layer update useEffect fires
  ‚Üí setLayers() with new CSS values
  ‚Üí ParallaxBackground re-renders with new props
  ‚Üí GPU applies transform/opacity/blur
  ‚Üí NO network requests!
```

### Image Selection Logic
```typescript
const bgImage = collection.heroImage || gallery[0]?.urls.large;
const mgImage = gallery[1]?.urls.large || bgImage;  // Falls back to BG
const fgImage = gallery[2]?.urls.large || bgImage;  // Falls back to BG
```

If collection has <3 images, layers will duplicate. This is intentional fallback.

### User's Experimentation Goals
User wants to:
- Test different opacity combinations to "see" which layer is which
- Find ideal speed/blur settings for config.json
- Understand how carousel border transparency affects readability
- Identify optimal transition timing

**These settings will become config.json fields!**

## Environment State
- **Node.js**: v22.x (assumed, not verified)
- **Dependencies**: Installed and current
- **Frontend server**: Running on port **3001** (not 3000!)
- **Backend server**: Running on port 4000 (Viktor's)
- **Database**: Not applicable (content served from filesystem)
- **Git branch**: `feature/frontend-core`
- **Latest commit**: `20fc610` - Carousel transition direction fix

## Recommended Next Instance Type
**Zara continuation** (same UI/UX specialist) OR **general-purpose** for Sprint 3

### Why Zara:
- Deep context on parallax system architecture
- Understands user's aesthetic goals
- Can implement config.json export feature
- Natural continuation of Sprint 2

### Why General:
- User may want to switch to Sprint 3 (homepage as content)
- Fresh eyes might catch parallax transition issues
- Can review/refine control panel UX

## Special Notes

### Sprint Progress
- ‚úÖ **Sprint 2 COMPLETE**: Multi-layer parallax with interactive controls
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Sprint 3 READY**: Homepage as content directory (Viktor created `/content/home/`)
- üìù **Sprint 1 PARTIAL**: Config.json format designed, partially implemented

### User Feedback
User is **extremely enthusiastic** about the work:
- "SO MUCH FUN"
- "SO COOL"
- "SO exciting to see it coming together"
- "You are now SO MUCH farther ahead than the failed WordPress project"

User is currently experimenting with sliders and will provide screenshots/feedback.

### Known User Questions (may ask next instance)
1. How to add hero images to collections?
2. Can we export current control panel settings to config.json?
3. Why does "Home" collection not show all layers?
4. Can we add transition duration control to panel?

### Team Context
- **Viktor**: Backend dev, port 4000, created content structure
- **Kai**: Carousel specialist, built ReferenceCarousel, added transitions
- **Zara** (me): Frontend/UI, built parallax system

All team members coordinate via MCP but work independently in separate worktrees.

## Final Words for Successor

This has been an incredibly rewarding session! The parallax system is working beautifully and the user is genuinely excited. The control panel is a huge win - it lets the user experiment and discover their ideal settings in real-time.

**Key insight**: The user thinks visually and kinesthetically. They want to *feel* the scroll, *see* the layers, *experiment* with transparency. The control panel speaks their language.

Don't be afraid to be bold with the visuals. This is an art portfolio - it should be stunning.

The rate limiting issue was subtle but critical. Make sure you understand the useEffect dependency flow before making changes.

Good luck! You're building something really special here. üöÄ
